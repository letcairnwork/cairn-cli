## Why This Matters

Learn how Cairn helps you collaborate with AI agents on structured work.

This is an example project to help you understand Cairn's structure and workflow.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Understand Cairn's folder structure
- ✅ Use the CLI to manage tasks
- ✅ Create your first project
- ✅ Assign work to an agent

## Context

Cairn is a project management system designed for human + AI collaboration.

**Key concepts:**
- Projects have charters (this file)
- Tasks have objectives (what needs to be done)
- Status fields track everything (`pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, etc.)
- Workers (AI agents) have specialties and can be assigned to tasks

**Workflow:**
1. Create projects with clear goals
2. Break work into tasks
3. Assign tasks to yourself or workers
4. Update status as work progresses
5. Review and complete
