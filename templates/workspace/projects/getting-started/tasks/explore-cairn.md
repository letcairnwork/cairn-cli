## Objective

Familiarize yourself with Cairn's structure and CLI commands.

By the end, you should understand where files live and how to use the CLI.

## Steps

1. Run `cairn my` to see this task (and others)
2. Run `cairn start explore-cairn` to mark this task in progress
3. Browse the workspace folders:
   - `projects/` - Your projects and tasks
   - `inbox/` - Quick capture area
   - `workers/` - AI agent definitions
   - `memory/` - Agent persistent memory
   - `skills/` - Shared knowledge
4. Read `AGENTS.md` to understand workspace conventions
5. Check the example worker: `workers/engineer/engineer.md`
6. Run `cairn done explore-cairn` when you're done

## What You'll Learn

- Where Cairn stores projects and tasks
- How to use basic CLI commands
- What workers are and how they work
- Where agents store their memory
