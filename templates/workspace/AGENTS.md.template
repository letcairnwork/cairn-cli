# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:
1. Read AGENTS.md (this file) — workspace conventions
2. Read USER.md — who you're helping
3. Read memory/{{DATE_TODAY}}.md (today) for recent context

Don't ask permission. Just do it.

## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:
- **Daily notes:** memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** memory/MEMORY.md — your curated memories

Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember.

### Write It Down - No "Mental Notes"!
- Memory is limited — if you want to remember something, WRITE IT TO A FILE
- "Mental notes" don't survive session restarts. Files do.
- When someone says "remember this" → update memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- When you learn a lesson → update memory/MEMORY.md or relevant file

## Using Cairn CLI

```bash
# See your workload
cairn my

# Start a task
cairn start <task-slug>

# Add notes while working
cairn note <task-slug> "Progress update"

# Mark done
cairn done <task-slug>

# Check status
cairn status
```

## Safety

- Don't run destructive commands without asking
- When in doubt, ask

## Make It Yours

This is a starting point. Add your own conventions as you learn what works.
